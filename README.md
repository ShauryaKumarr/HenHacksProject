At the intersection of personal experiences and technological innovation, **RoomieUD** stands out as a dynamic solution born from the challenges encountered in the pursuit of compatible roommates during our initial college semester. Frustrated by the limitations of the UD Housing portal and the shortcomings of mainstream social media platforms, we embarked on a journey to craft a more user-centric and effective roommate-matching experience.

## The Problem

The UD Housing portal's brief questionnaire often falls short, pairing individuals based on basic preferences such as sleep habits and lifestyle choices. Unfortunately, it neglects crucial aspects, leaving profiles incomplete, devoid of images, and navigating the platform proves far from user-friendly. Meanwhile, social media giants like Instagram and Reddit come with their own set of issues â€“ ghosting, faceless profiles, and more.

## Our Solution

*Enter RoomieUD*, a revolutionary approach to roommate matching. Drawing inspiration from platforms like Instagram, we seamlessly integrate social aspects into the process. Users not only fill out a comprehensive questionnaire covering sleep, substances, and lifestyle but also showcase their personalities through biographies, interests, and a unique percentage score reflecting compatibility.

## Implementation Challenges

The journey wasn't without its hurdles. Implementing the Euclidean Algorithm, crucial for predicting the correlation between data sets, presented unexpected challenges. Storing user input, crafting front-end pages aligned with our Figma ideation, and ensuring a smooth user experience posed their own set of bugs to squash.

## Lessons Learned

Through **RoomieUD**, we expanded our skill set and knowledge. GitHub Live became our integrated environment of choice, providing collaborative coding experiences. Wrestling with the intricacies of our algorithm's statistics, mastering Figma for seamless design translation, honing presentation skills, and cultivating a robust debugging mentality were invaluable lessons gained throughout this development journey.

In essence, **RoomieUD** is more than just a platform; it's a testament to our growth, both technically and personally, in the pursuit of creating a better, more user-friendly solution to a common challenge.
