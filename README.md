Inspired by personal struggles experienced by the authors through the process of finding a roomate for the first year of college, RoomieUD is a robust app that users to meet potential 'Matches' and see if they are compatible. Frustrated by the limitations of the UD Housing portal and the shortcomings of mainstream social media platforms, we embarked on a journey to craft a more user-friendly and effective roommate-matching experience.

## The Problem

The UD Housing portal's brief questionnaire often falls short, pairing individuals based on basic preferences such as sleep habits, substance tolerance, and lifestyle choices. Unfortunately, it neglects crucial aspects, leaving profiles incomplete, devoid of images, making it hard for their roomate manager section to gain traction due to the ineffective communication abilities. Meanwhile, social media giants like Instagram and Reddit come with their own set of issues â€“ ghosting, faceless profiles, and more.

## Our Solution

*Enter RoomieUD*, a revolutionary approach to roommate matching. Drawing inspiration from platforms like Instagram, we seamlessly integrate social aspects into the process. Users not only fill out a comprehensive questionnaire covering sleep, substances, and lifestyle but also showcase their personalities through biographies, interests, and a unique percentage score reflecting compatibility.

## Implementation Challenges

The journey wasn't without its hurdles. Implementing the Euclidean Algorithm, crucial for predicting the correlation between data sets, presented unexpected challenges. Storing user input locally, crafting front-end pages aligned with our Figma ideation, and ensuring a smooth user experience posed their own set of bugs to tackle.

## Lessons Learned

Through **RoomieUD**, we expanded our skill set and knowledge. GitHub Live became our integrated environment of choice, providing collaborative coding experiences. Learning the statistical knowledge behind our algorithm's statistics, mastering Figma for seamless design creation, perfecting our presentation skills, and most importantly, cultivating a robust debugging mentality were invaluable lessons gained throughout this development journey.

To summarize, **RoomieUD** is more than just a platform; it's a testament to our growth, both technically and personally, in the pursuit of creating a better, more user-friendly solution to a common challenge.
